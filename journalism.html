        <h3>Behind a radio host's microphone</h3>
        <p class="article-excerpt">
The car is freezing, your backpack is comically heavy, and you tune into the pop station with the jingle you memorized at ten and never forgot. The car next to you is playing the same song at the same time. Across the city, a radio host settles behind their microphone. They pull headphones over their ears and queue the day’s playlist. As the radio host welcomes an unseen audience, they wonder how many are tuned in. Who is on the other side?

        <h3>The double bind of female sexuality</h3>
        <p class="article-excerpt">
          She’s on her hands and knees as an unpictured man playfully tugs her blonde hair. But when pop star Sabrina Carpenter was shooting the cover of her new album, “Man’s Best Friend,” she wasn’t thinking of objectification. Carpenter said she saw the pose as powerful. Many viewers saw it differently. For some, the image reinforces long-standing stereotypes about the submissive female role rather than reclaiming and redefining female sexuality by being in control.

        <p class="article-excerpt">
          Chirping trumpets and proud parents’ cheers marked the beginning of Celebrate the Music on April 27. Between performances, attendees lined up to eat local and enjoyed booths manned by community volunteers.  Each year, Celebrate the Music is organized as a whole-day event at Twin Pines Park to immerse the local community in performances from school music programs around Belmont. It’s complete with a battle of the bands between the University of California, Davis (UC Davis), and Carlmont High School students.

        <h3>Opinion: Hobbies should go beyond productivity</h3>
        <p class="article-excerpt">
          Pursuing a hobby should not be stressful. The pressure to produce permeates our understanding of what a hobby should be. Hobbies that turn into something more are a great way to pursue passions, especially as a teenager. But no one is born CEO of a successful bracelet business, and the pressure to seemingly wake up one morning and do so makes teens too anxious to start.

        <h3>No Kings Day: Millions protest against Trump policies</h3>
        <p class="article-excerpt">
          In San Francisco, protesters from across the city gathered under the banner ‘No Kings’ to call out government corruption, defend human rights, and demand a return to accountability and democratic values. Among them were Liz Isaacs and Kate Aks, who helped form a human banner stretching across Ocean Beach that spelled out the protest’s defining message: No Kings. For many attendees, the event offered a way to stand together in their frustration, creating a sense of strength and purpose.

          Carlmont students and community members saw months of work pay off at the seventh annual Belmont Water Dog Run, a volunteer-led fundraiser. “You see the same people over and over and over again,” said Huan Phan, the head of the interns. “It feels like the community reconnects.”

          At the age of 17, Sophia Park passed the California State Bar Exam. She became a prosecutor for a district attorney in Tulare County at 18 years old. “Seeing where I’m at right now, I wouldn’t trade it for anything,” Park said in an interview with the New York Times. “I’m having an experience not many get to have.”
